        <h3> The whole story:</h3>
        <p> Technological devices have always amazed me and the internet is my true home.<br>
        Obviously I would have played with Barbies if only they had carried a laptop instead of a purse.<br>
        Growing up in the wonderful town of Dresden and going to <a href="http://www.manos-dresden.de/">this</a> amazing school I was often frustrated because everybody was so much smarter then me and seemed to understand everything related to natural sciences and IT better than me. I decided that I'd rather pursue studies in humanities. After 4 semesters at <a href="www.zu.de">Zeppelin University </a>where I study Sociology, Politics and Economics I noticed how much I actually miss the clarity and logic that accompany science. That's why I started an online-course for coding and quickly noticed that I was not alone on this. With an awesome team we brought <a href="www.codecats.io">CodeCats</a> to life. An initiative that promotes code literacy, especially amongst women. This summer we organized a summercamp with about 50 participants who all learn to code. We're in this together and we're rocking it.
